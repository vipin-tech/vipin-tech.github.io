<p>The aim of this project was to perform Data Analysis using Mathematica Tool. The programming language used for in this tool is
Wolfram. Wolfram Mathematica is a modern technical computing system spanning most areas of technical computing
including neural networks, machine learning, image processing, geometry, data science, visualizations, and others.
The system is used in many technical, scientific, engineering, mathematical, and computing fields.</p>

<p>Exloratory Data Analysis is performed on Kiva Loan Dataset. Along with this Geographical plotting is carried on this Dataset.</p>
<p>Various Machine Learning alogrithms are applied on both labelled and unlabelled data using modules and procedures provided
  by Mathematica and accuracy of each alogrithm is comapred and analyzed.</p>

<h4>We need Mathematica to be installed to open nb files.</h4><br />
