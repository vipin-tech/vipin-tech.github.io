<p>Collections is a built-in Python module that implements specialized container datatypes providing alternatives to Python’s general purpose built-in containers such as dict, list, set, and tuple.</p>

<p>Some of the useful data structures present in this module are:</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">namedtuple</h2>

<p>The data stored in a plain tuple can only be accessed through indexes as can be seen in the example below:</p>

<code>
  plain_tuple = (10,11,12,13)
  plain_tuple[0]
  10
  plain_tuple[3]
  13
</code>

<p>We can’t give names to individual elements stored in a tuple. Now, this might not be needed in simple cases. However, in case a tuple has many fields this might be kind of a necessity and will also impact the code’s readability.
It is here that namedtuple’s functionality comes into the picture. It is a function for tuples with Named Fields and can be seen as an extension of the built-in tuple data type. Named tuples assign meaning to each position in a tuple and allow for more readable, self-documenting code. Each object stored in them can be accessed through a unique (human-readable) identifier and this frees us from having to remember integer indexes. Let’s see its implementation.</p>

<code>
  from collections import namedtuple
  fruit = namedtuple('fruit','number variety color')
  guava = fruit(number=2,variety='HoneyCrisp',color='green')
  apple = fruit(number=5,variety='Granny Smith',color='red')
</code>

<p>We construct the namedtuple by first passing the object type name (fruit) and then passing a string with the variety of fields as a string with spaces between the field names. We can then call on the various attributes:</p>

<code>
  guava.color
  'green'
  apple.variety
  'Granny Smith'
  </code>
